# Car Data Visualisation


## Description
This project uses a Jupyter notebook named data_viz_task.ipynb. The code will generate the following graphs from the Cars93.csv dataset. 
○ A box plot for the revs per mile for the Audi, Hyundai, Suzuki, and
Toyota car manufacturers. 
○ A histogram of MPG in the city. On the same axis, show a histogram of
MPG on the highway. 
○ A lineplot showing the relationship between the ‘Wheelbase’ and
‘turning circle’. 
○ A bar plot showing the mean horsepower for each car Type (Small,
Midsize, etc.). 
I then carried out some analysis of each chart.
